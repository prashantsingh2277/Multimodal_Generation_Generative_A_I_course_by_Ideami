# Multimodal_Generation_Generative_A_I_course_by_Ideami

Importing Libraries: The script imports various libraries, including PyTorch, imageio, torchvision, and CLIP. It also defines utility functions for displaying images and normalizing data.

Initializing Models and Loading Checkpoints: The script loads the CLIP model and VQ-VAE-2 model by downloading checkpoints from the provided URLs and using them to initialize the models.

Define Parameters: The script defines some parameters for optimization, including learning rate, batch size, weight decay, and noise factor.

Optimization Functions: The script defines functions to optimize the generated image based on textual prompts. It uses the cosine similarity loss between the image encodings and text encodings to optimize the image.

Image Generation and Optimization Loop: The script contains a training loop that iteratively optimizes the generated image to match the given prompts. It generates image crops using augmentations and updates the parameters using the defined optimization functions.

Interpolation: The script includes a function to interpolate between the generated images to create a smooth transition effect. The interpolation is performed by varying the parameters of the VQ-VAE-2 model.

Generating Art: The script uses the trained VQ-VAE-2 model to generate images based on the provided prompts. It saves the generated images and creates an output video showcasing the interpolated results.

Displaying the Generated Video: The script displays the generated video as an HTML video element using IPython.
